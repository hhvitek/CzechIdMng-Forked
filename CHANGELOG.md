# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.


## [13.0.0]

### Administrator
- ðŸŸ  [#3016](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/3016) - In the provisioning archive, the boolean value 'false' was displayed as an empty String. It now behaves as expected.
  - If you use a virtual system to which you added a custom attribute of the type `java.lang.Boolean`, make sure to change the type of the attribute in the form definition of the system's accounts (VsAccount type) to Boolean. Otherwise, you will see failures in the provisioning.
- ðŸŸ  [#3156](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/3156) - Configuration property `idm.pub.app.show.identityRole.table.columns` now supports column `owner`, which serves as a universal replacement for the original column `identityContract`. This column is displayed by default, but if you use this configuration property to change order of columns, you need to replace original property name with the new one.

## [12.2.0]

### Administrator
- ðŸŸ¡ [#2613](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/2613) - When some tree node has non existing parent in source, IdM will log it as create error item. **If the tree node was created with correct parent and later the parent has changed in the source, IdM will process it as update error instead of missing account!**
- ðŸŸ¢ [#3055](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/3055) - You can now allow users to run only one report without giving them access to all reports.
- ðŸŸ¢ [#3089](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/3089) - Synchronization logs now contain more information about the configuration options used for the synchronization.
- ðŸŸ¢ [#2949](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/2949) - New action for synchronizations is available: ignore and do not log. When used, the synchronization items which are ignored are not logged which can improve performance. **This is an alternative to to the ignore action.** It is particularly useful for delete reconciliations where most synchronization items are ignored. See the wiki [doc](https://wiki.czechidm.com/tutorial/adm/synchronization#synchronization_states_and_actions) page for details.
- ðŸŸ  [#3052](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/3052) - Support for multiple persistence contexts
  - There are by default two datasources configured
    - datasource - default datasource, which is being used for almost all database communication (Flyway, JPA repositories)
    - loggingDatasource - This datasource is used by our database logging appender to write logging messages, when databes appender is enabled. The reason why this is done by separate datasource is to prevent database logging to hog database connections and hinder the application performance
  - Configuration properties, that have changed with introduction of additional datasources:
    - *`spring.datasource.url` â†’* *`spring.datasource.jdbcUrl`*
    - `spring.datasource.hikari.*` â†’ `spring.datasource.*`

See the wiki [doc](https://wiki.czechidm.com/devel/documentation/application_configuration/dev/backend?s[]=%2Adatasource%2A#additional_datasources) page for details.

### Developer

- ðŸŸ  [#3052](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/3052) - Support for multiple persistence contexts
  - If you are using `EntityManager` in your code, you will run into the issue with autowiring. In order to fix it, you need to explicitly specify, which `EntityManager` bean you want spring to autowire. You can use
    - `@CoreEntityManager` annotation, if you want to autowire main application datasource (in most cases you want to use this)
    - `@Qualifier("coreEntityManager")` annotation, if you want to autowire main application datasource and do not want to explicitly define dependency on core-api module


## [12.1.0]

### Administrator

- ðŸŸ  [#3008](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/3008) - Bulk actions for changing and removing contract guarantees only show the current guarantees for selected identities. If the bulk action is to be used for more than 500 identities, increase the value ``idm.sec.core.filter.check.size.maximum``. See the wiki [doc](https://wiki.czechidm.com/devel/documentation/contracts/adm/contract_guarantee) page for details.
- ðŸŸ  [#3036](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/3036) - Configuration od IdmDbAppender must be changed. If you are using database logging appender, replace the following section in your logback-spring.xml files

      <appender name="DB" class="eu.bcvsolutions.idm.core.exception.IdmDbAppender">
            <connectionSource class="ch.qos.logback.core.db.DriverManagerConnectionSource">
                <driverClass>${spring.datasource.driver-class-name}</driverClass>
                <url>${spring.datasource.url}</url>
                <user>${spring.datasource.username}</user>
                <password>${spring.datasource.password}</password>
            </connectionSource>
      </appender>

  with

        <appender name="DB" class="eu.bcvsolutions.idm.core.exception.IdmDbAppender">
        </appender>

### Developer

- ðŸŸ¢ [#3008](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/3008) - Added support for preprocessing to bulk actions. Preprocessing allows you to filter the values in forms based on the entities selected for the bulk action.

## [12.0.0]

### Administrator

- ðŸŸ  [#2885](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/2885) - Application theme was redesigned from scratch. Configurable less variables and cascade styles are not available anymore. Application theme and logo is configurable from UI now (menu Configuration -> Application theme).


### Developer

- ðŸŸ  [#2885](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/2885) - Application theme was redesigned from scratch. Configurable less variables and cascade styles are not available anymore:
  - ðŸŸ  CSS removed - ``btn-*``, ``label-*``, ``badge-*``, ``modal-*``, ``popover-*``
  - ðŸŸ¢ Markdown font removed - roboto font is used in whole application.
  - ðŸŸ¢ Modal ``className`` property removed - modal windows are unified in whole application.
  - ðŸŸ¡ Modal ``closeButton`` property is supported with ``ModalHeader`` and ``ModalBody`` as direct ``Modal`` child only. The same with scroll paper feature (~ affix footer buttons feature).
  _How to fix it: If ``closeButton`` will be missing on your modal window - move ``<form>`` element into ``<Basic.ModalBody>``._
  - ðŸŸ¢ Popover properties ``focus`` trigger and  ``delayShow`` removed. Property ``focus`` trigger didn't work even before and property ``delayShow`` was unused.
  - ðŸŸ  ``Index.js``, ``layout`` in frontend ``czechidm-app`` module was updated - don't forget to **update this module**, if project specific app module is used.

## [11.2.0]

### Administrator

- ðŸŸ¢ [#2815](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/2815) - Profile image is validated now:
  - default maximum image file size is ``512KB``. Change configuration property ``idm.sec.core.identity.profile.image.max-file-size`` if needed.
_Example ``idm.sec.core.identity.profile.image.max-file-size=200KB``._
- ðŸŸ¢ [#813](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/813) - Configuration property ``idm.pub.core.identity.create.defaultContract.enabled`` for enable / disable creating default contract for newly created identity is deprecated and will be removed in future releases. Use new configuration property ``idm.sec.core.identity.create.defaultContract.enabled=false`` (property name changed only).
- ðŸŸ¡ [#2717](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/2717) - Enhance audit logging in the text log of CzechIdM:
  - in order to work this feature properly it is necessary to override the setting of log formats in the project logback.xml file. See the wiki [doc](https://wiki.czechidm.com/devel/documentation/audit/dev/audit_logging_for_siem_tools?s[]=%2Asiem%2A#audit_logger_configuration) page for details.

### Developer

- ðŸŸ¢ [#2815](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/2815) - Profile image is validated now:
  - ``image/*`` content types are supported only. Content type is required now, when images are uploaded by rest endpoint.

## [11.1.0]

### Administrator

- ðŸŸ¢ [#2815](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/2815) - Role catalogue item code is hidden in role catalogue tree by default (in role select and agendas). Set application property ``idm.pub.app.show.roleCatalogue.tree.code=true``, then code will be shown in tree again.

### Developer

- ðŸŸ¢ [#1865](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/1865) - Monitoring agenda was redesigned. Monitoring evaluators can be registered from custom module now.

## [11.0.0]

### Administrator

- ðŸŸ¡ [#2684](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/2684) - **Some messages are missing in the Logging events.**
  - **Why:** This fix solves an issue where some logged messages cannot be saved **to the database** (because the message is too long or contains prohibited characters). The solution is to use a DB appender that solves this.
  - **What to do:** Change a log database appender from ``ch.qos.logback.classic.db.DBAppender`` to ``eu.bcvsolutions.idm.core.exception.IdmDbAppender`` in the log configuration file (**lockback-spring.xml**).
- ðŸŸ  [#2739](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/2739) - **GetDefaultDN Groovy script used by AD Wizard has to be re-deployed.** This script has been updated and has to be re-deployed in order to apply changes in the new version. This script is essential for correct funtion of the AD Wizard.
- ðŸŸ  [#2758](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/2758) - **Java 11 is used and required for using CzechIdM application.** Update to Java 11 in your environment.
- ðŸŸ¡ [#2775](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/2775) - **PostgreSQL 9.x and 10.x are not oficially supported anymore.** (Although it should still work.) PostgreSQL 11.x, 12.x, 13.x are oficially supported. Update to PostgreSQL 12 (recommended) in your environment.
- ðŸŸ¡ [#2775](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/2775) - **PostgreSQL 13.x is now supported.**
- ðŸŸ¡ [#2775](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/2775) - **Apache Tomcat 8.0.x and 8.5.x are not oficially supported anymore.** (Although the 8.5.x branch should still work.) Update to Apache Tomcat 9.0.x branch.
- ðŸŸ¡ [#2775](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/2775) - **WildFly application server is no longer supported.** Change your application server to Apache Tomcat.
- ðŸŸ¡ [#2775](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/2775) - **Microsoft Internet Explorer 11 is no longer oficially supported.** Use other supported browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, etc.).

### Developer

- [#2622](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/2622) - **Libraries used on frontend were changed. Frontend build script was rewritten and simplified**.
  - What is needed to change after update for developing product or custom module:
    - ðŸŸ¡ Gulp 4 and Babel 7 libraries are used for building frontend application. Read [doc](https://github.com/bcvsolutions/CzechIdMng/tree/develop/Realization/frontend#install-gulp-as-global) how to uninstall and install the new Gulp version. Before building frontend, delete all npm libraries in ``czechidm-app/node_modules`` and all symlinks to CzechIdM modules in folder ``czechidm-app/czechidm-modules`` and [install frontend](https://github.com/bcvsolutions/CzechIdMng/tree/develop/Realization/frontend#install-the-dependencies-for-application-module) libraries from scratch.
    - ðŸŸ¢ Linter configuration has to be changed in custom module for analyze javascript source code. Make this [change](https://github.com/bcvsolutions/CzechIdMng/commit/905e4c0835551ce746be8d65cbf06aa452b86033#diff-593209d8b7e6a66839cb42ec72cfc976aea35ccbf2c28cbdb0aefffcbab36f26) in ``.eslintrc`` file in your custom module.
    - ðŸŸ¢ Copy file with Babel configuration ``babel.config.json`` to your module (needed for correct work linter in IDEs). As a source, you can use [babel.config.json](https://github.com/bcvsolutions/CzechIdMng/blob/develop/Realization/frontend/czechidm-core/babel.config.json) file from product core module.
  - Other notes (mainly informative):
    - Npx installation is not required now.
    - Gulp tasks ``install``, ``build`` and ``default`` (~ watch for development) are exposed only. Other tasks was removed (e.g. makeModules, test) and they are included in exposed tasks (e.g. tests are executed in ``default`` task). If other task is used and required for external usage, please let us know.  
    - Npm tasks ``product-install``, ``modules-link``, ``modules-link-or-skip``, ``czechidm-modules-link`` and  ``lint`` are exposed only. Other tasks was removed (e.g. test). If other task is used and required for external usage, please let us know.
    - [Installing custom module](https://github.com/bcvsolutions/CzechIdMng/tree/develop/Realization/frontend#optional-install-the-dependencies-for-external-module) for development was a little simplified.
    - Localization tests are executed only - frontend tests were obsolete anyway => we need to redesign tests on frontend from scratch in next version.
    - Frontend libraries were updated (except React => React update is not fully backward compatible).
    - Frontend libraries were removed:
      - ``sockjs-client``, ``stompjs`` - websocket support was @deprecated @since 9.2.0.
      - ``rimraf`` - library used for build only, use newer ``del`` library instead if needed.
      - ``path``, ``run-sequence``, ``gulp-image``, ``gulp-util`` - libraries used for previous build only - replacement is not needed.
      - ``jsdom``, ``nock``, ``react-addons-test-utils``, ``redux-mock-store`` - libraries used for tests only - localization tests are executed only - frontend tests were obsolete anyway => we need to redesign test on frontend from scratch in next version.
      - ``react-tools``, ``redux-devtools`` - deprecated dev libraries (an unused in product).
      - ``faker`` - unused dev library (in product) for generating random (~test) data - if it is used in a custom module, please let us know.
- ðŸŸ¡ [#2758](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/2758) - **Java 11 is used and required for using, developing and building CzechIdM application.** Update to Java 11 in your environment and configure your IDE to use it.
- ðŸŸ¡ (_edited 5.5.2021_) [#2758](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/2758) - **Use Jacoco plugin version 0.8.7** or higher in your module **pom.xml** descriptor (example commit is [here](https://github.com/bcvsolutions/CzechIdMng/commit/e931000a4f3456ba9b9e8072c7fb037c3a9a9f80)). Older versions (e.g. 0.7.x) will throw exception (_Corrupted stdin stream in forked JVM 1._), when tests are executed under Java 11.


## [10.8.0]

### Administrator

- ðŸŸ¢ [#2628](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/2628) - Remote connector server agenda was added. New agenda is available under ``Systems - Connector servers`` menu. **Remote connector server configuration moved from system detail to this standalone agenda**. Check if remote servers are properly initialized after upgrade (e.g. try to test system with remote connector server usage from system detail - configuration content).

## [10.7.0]

### Administrator

- ðŸŸ¡ [#2506](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/2506) - [Two-factor authentication](https://wiki.czechidm.com/devel/documentation/security/dev/security#two-factor_authentication) is supported optionally, but authentication mechanism was refactored from scratch. **Test your configured authentication method (e.g. sso, kerberos, authentication by header or by remote user, authentication by target systems) carefully after upgrade.**
- ðŸŸ¢ [#2506](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/2506) - **Basic authentication checks password, which must be changed - password with this requirement cannot be used now**.
The 'password must be changed' flag was not previously checked in basic authentication, **it is now**. If you are using basic authentication, verify that you do not have this flag active. Password has to be changed the standard way to use it in basic authentication.
_**Basic authentication** = Non-standard login, typically from another external system (eg Scim, SIEM ... )._

### Developer

- ðŸŸ¢ [#2603](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/2603) - IdM tool - [resolving third-party module dependencies automatically](https://github.com/bcvsolutions/CzechIdMng/tree/develop/Realization/backend/tool#third-party-module-dependencies) is conditional now. Use new tool argument ``--resolve-dependencies`` to enable resolving third party libraries automatically, when project with modules is built.

## [10.6.0]

### Administrator

- ðŸŸ¢ [#1981](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/1981) - Design of bulk actions used in tables was changed. Filter is now expanded to the top and quick buttons are shown for the first five actions (by default), next actions are in drop down menu. Bulk action order was changed too. Order, icon, level, enforce quick button or disable bulk action can be configured by application setting. Quick button count (or disable quick buttons) can be configured by application setting too.
- ðŸŸ¡ [#1981](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/1981) - Configuration property ``idm.pub.core.identity.delete`` is deprecated now - action can be disabled by bulk action configurable api - **use ``idm.sec.core.bulk-action.identity-delete-bulk-action.enabled=false``** instead.
- ðŸŸ¢ [#2355](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/2355) - IdM now supports AES-256 key for encryption and decryption confidential storage. If you want use the new encryption please change key via long running task ``ChangeConfidentialStorageKeyTaskExecutor``.
- ðŸŸ¡ (_edited 22.2.2021_) [#2355](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/2355) - For every new or changed item in confidential storage will be generated new unique initialization vector. For security reasons, you should encrypt existing values in the confidential storage with newly generated initialization vector, because they reused the same initialization vector, which can be exploited. Also a warning message would appear in the application log, until you resave confidential storage values with the unique initialization vector. You could do this by manually saving the items again - fill again the passwords for connected systems, fill again confidential configuration properties, or create some custom script/task to do it. From the version 10.8, use the task [Generate initialization vectors for the confidential storage](https://wiki.czechidm.com/devel/documentation/adm/confidential_storage#generate_initialization_vectors). For older versions, you could [change the confidential storage key](https://wiki.czechidm.com/devel/documentation/adm/confidential_storage#change_the_confidential_storage_key) to encrypt all values in bulk, but read carefully the notes in the documentation.
- ðŸŸ¡ (_edited 26.1.2021_) [#2355](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/2355) - Check if your application server is starting with the parameter ``java.security.egd=/dev/./urandom`` (Linux) or ``java.security.egd=file:/dev/urandom`` (Windows) (the parameter would be also visible in the ``Environment configuration`` table in ``Settings - Configuration``). If not, add it into starting parameter for the application server (typically ``/etc/systemd/system/tomcat.service`` in Linux, Java Options set by ``Tomcat8w.exe`` in Windows).
- ðŸŸ¢ (_edited 15.1.2021_) [#2355](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/2355) - Generating initial vector may block as entropy is being gathered. Please check size of entropy in your operation system (in Linux: ``cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail`` should return more than 2000).
- ðŸŸ¢ [#2519](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/2519) - Better exception is thrown, when count of filter parameters exceeded limit (e.g. when identities are find by roles filter). Default limit is ``500``. Limit is Related to database count of query parameters (e.g. ``Oracle = 1000, MSSql = 2100`` by default). You can [configure](https://wiki.czechidm.com/devel/documentation/application_configuration/dev/backend#entity_filters) limit by your environment if needed.
- ðŸŸ¢ [#2493](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/2493) - Attachment [storage path](https://wiki.czechidm.com/devel/documentation/application_configuration/dev/backend#attachment_storage) is used as default [backup folder](https://wiki.czechidm.com/devel/documentation/application_configuration/dev/backend#backup), when backup folder is [not configured])(https://wiki.czechidm.com/devel/documentation/application_configuration/dev/backend#backup). Exception is not thrown by default anymore.


### Developer

- ðŸŸ¢ [#1981](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/1981) - Bulk action configuration is available now under configurable component type ``bulk-action``. Bulk action order, icon, level, enforce quick button or disable bulk action at all can be configured by application setting.
- ðŸŸ¡ [#1981](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/1981) - Configuration property ``idm.pub.core.identity.delete`` is deprecated now - action can be disabled by bulk action configurable api - **use ``idm.sec.core.bulk-action.identity-delete-bulk-action.enabled=false``** instead.
- ðŸŸ¢ [#2074](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/2074) - Report executor (``ReportExecutor``) extends schedulable long running task (``SchedulableTaskExecutor``) now. Report can be scheduled from long running task agenda and result can be sent as notification by topic setting.
- ðŸŸ¢ [#2074](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/2074) - **Report parameters can be localized from custom module now**.
- ðŸŸ  [#1636](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/1636) - Business role assignment was redesigned from the scratch - business roles are assigned by the standard role request now. **Prevent to assign identity role directly without role request - business roles will be assigned for compatibility reason (is deprecated and will be removed in future version) but full account manager occurs in this way**. Prevent to use deprecated methods ``IdmRoleCompositionService#assignSubRoles``, ``IdmRoleCompositionService#updateSubRoles``, ``IdmRoleCompositionService#removeSubRoles`` in your modules and use role request only.
- ðŸŸ¢ [#2413](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/2413) - New caches were registered:
  - ``core:all-sub-roles`` - cache for business role sub roles. Cache is cleared automatically, when business role definition is changed. **Memory usage is 25KB per business role with 10 sub roles**.
- ðŸŸ¢ [#2493](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/2493) - Service ``DefaultIdmScriptService`` constructor was simplified - check your module, if you are overriding this service.
- ðŸŸ¢ [#2493](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/2493) - Method ``Recoverable#redeploy`` checks permission now - ``permission`` parameter was added to interface). Method usage is backward compatible. If you are creating new recoverable service or overriding ``Recoverable`` service from product, add ``permission`` parameter into method definition and implement checking permission properly.


## [10.5.0]

### Administrator

- ðŸŸ¢ [#2413](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/2413) - New caches were registered:
  - ``core:token-cache`` - Cache stores logged user tokens. Cache is evicted automatically after token is changed. Cache expiration is 1 minute  - token expiration id prolonged automatically in one minute window, when token used.. **Memory usage per logged user is 25KB**.
  - (_edited 15.1.2021_) Decide if your project processes more than e.g. 10000 concurrently logged users in an hour. In such case, consider increasing the size of the Java heap (``-Xmx`` in the Java options of the Tomcat service), otherwise there is nothing to worry.
- ðŸŸ¡ (_edited 15.1.2021_) [#812](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/812) - Init application data was refactored:
  - default CzechIdM roles (e.g. ``superAdminRole``, ``userRole``) and other init data (e.g. default password policies) are created and updated after new version is installed, read more in [documentation](https://wiki.czechidm.com/devel/documentation/architecture/dev/events/init-data).
  - The roles created before upgrade are not changed automatically, but you should consider to make use of the product roles to make future upgrades easier. If your project doesn't use specific settings of the userRole, or it only adds additional permissions on top of the [basic setup](https://wiki.czechidm.com/devel/documentation/security/dev/authorization#default_settings_of_permissions_for_an_identity_profile), it's recommended to switch to the product provided roles. Example steps for the ``userRole``: 1) rename the role to ``userRoleBackup`` just before upgrade, 2) let the product create new roles after the upgraded version first starts up, 3) add additional permissions to some other role and add it as a subrole of the ``userRole`` (or use some other new provided product roles, e.g. ``userManagerRole`` which allows managers to change roles for their subordinates, or ``virtualSystemImplementerRole`` which grants necessary permissions to virtual system implementers). **Note** that you can't switch to the product provided roles if your project e.g. doesn't allow the standard users to request for roles (``IdmIdentity`` - ``Change Roles`` - ``SelfIdentityEvaluator``)- the product role allows it always.
  - to disable updating (and creating) product provided init data set property ``idm.sec.core.init.data.enabled=false``.
  - default administrator identity (with ``admin`` username) is created, only if no other identity with admin role (``superAdminRole`` by default configuration) exists.
  - **``ProvisioningQueueTaskExecutor`` is not scheduled by default** - asynchronous system feature is not used and will be deprecated. Remove this task from the scheduled tasks in your project (if you don't have any system using asynchronous provisioning, which is rare).
  - **All HR processes ``HrEnableContractProcess``, ``HrEndContractProcess ``, ``HrContractExclusionProcess `` are scheduled by default now** - read more in [documentation](https://wiki.czechidm.com/devel/documentation/architecture/dev/events/init-data#scheduled_tasks). Check the settings of the **daily scheduled synchronizations of contracts** or contract slices in your project. If the option **``After end, start the HR processes`` is checked in any of the synchronizations** the HR processes will be started after the synchronization, so you typically don't want to start them again and you should remove their scheduled starts (but keep the tasks in the ``Scheduled tasks`` agenda).
- ðŸŸ¢ [#2404](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/2404) - **All automatic roles are assigned through asynchronous role requests now** (to preserve order of provisioning operations). When long running tasks (LRT) for processing automatic roles ends, then role requests are prepared only => roles will be assigned asynchronously and they are not available right after LRT ends.
- ðŸŸ¢ [#2441](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/2441) - [Default user role](https://wiki.czechidm.com/devel/documentation/security/dev/authorization#default_policies) supports business roles now.
- ðŸŸ¢ Menu item **Task scheduler** moved higher in sidebar menu **Settings** - right after **Configuration** menu item.


### Developer

- ðŸŸ¡ [#2325](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/2325) - The frontend component ``PasswordChangeAccounts`` was changed and now supports uniform password. Options now contain array of accounts instead of simple account ID. Please if your project implements its own password component or overrides the product component, update the behavior with options like in the product component.
- ðŸŸ¢ [#2386](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/2386) - All additional methods defined in ``SysSystemAttributeMappingRepository`` are deprecated now - new properties were added into system attribute mapping filter and predicates are implemented in ``DefaultSysSystemAttributeMappingService#toPredicates`` method. Filter properties (builders) can be registered in custom module now.
- ðŸŸ  [#812](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/812) - Init application data was refactored:
  - default CzechIdM roles (e.g. ``superAdminRole``, ``userRole``) and other init data (e.g. default password policies) are created and updated after new version is installed, **read more in [documentation](https://wiki.czechidm.com/devel/documentation/architecture/dev/events/init-data)**.
  - Default user role (``userRole``) is configured for test usage now. Use new ``AbstractEvaluatorIntegrationTest`` superclass for authorization policies test, where default role should be disabled.
  - **Role type enumeration (value ``SYSTEM``) is used now for product provided default roles**. It was used before for ``superAdminRole`` only - now is used for all product provided default roles and is used for update role authorization policies, when new CzechIdM version is installed, read more in [documentation](https://wiki.czechidm.com/devel/documentation/architecture/dev/events/init-data).
  - **Role type values ``LOGIN``, ``BUSINESS``, ``TECHNICAL`` are deprecated (unused from begin) - prevent to use this types in custom modules - change script is provided in product - deprecated values are set to ``null``**.
  - Components ``InitTestData``, ``InitDemoData`` are deprecated and they are not initialized during application starts. ``InitApplicationData`` publish ``INIT`` event type for main IdM module (``app``) only. Avoid ``InitApplicationData`` dependency in you module. Use [processors](https://wiki.czechidm.com/devel/documentation/architecture/dev/events/init-data) to create init, test or demo data in you custom module. For example, **if your module init eav form definitions and attributes, then implement processor (see ``InitFormDefinitionProcessor``) with order (e.g. -175) before all [identities are created](https://wiki.czechidm.com/devel/documentation/architecture/dev/events/init-data).**
  - Scheduled task initiation was moved into [processors](https://wiki.czechidm.com/devel/documentation/architecture/dev/events/init-data) with defined order and new **superclass ``BaseScheduledTaskInitializer`` was added - use this class in your module** for schedule default tasks and create new processor. ``AbstractScheduledTaskInitializer`` is deprecated now.
  - Constant ``InitApplicationData#ADMIN_ROLE`` is deprecated, prevent to use it in your module. Admin role can be changed by configuration property ``idm.sec.core.role.admin=superAdminRole``.
 - ðŸŸ¡ [#2404](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/2404) - **All automatic roles are assigned through asynchronous role requests now** (to preserve order of provisioning operations). When long running tasks (LRT) for processing automatic roles ends, then role requests are prepared only => roles will be assigned asynchronously and they are not available right after LRT ends.
 - ðŸŸ¡ [#2248](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/2248) - Synchronization - Extended attribute values are storing together with the entity now. This means that the event for IdmFormInstanceDto is published during synchronization now (for each formable item).

### Administrator

- ðŸŸ¢ [#2366](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/2366) - New caches were registered:
  - ``core:form-definition-cache`` - Cache stores form definitions (eav). Cache is evicted automatically after form definition or attribute is changed. **Memory usage per application is 25KB per definition with 10 attributes**.
  - (_edited 15.1.2021_) Decide if your project uses more than e.g. 10000 EAV attributes. In such case, consider increasing the size of the Java heap (``-Xmx`` in the Java options of the Tomcat service), otherwise there is nothing to worry.

### Developer

- ðŸŸ¡ (_edited 4.9.2020_) [#2366](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/2366) - new cache ``core:form-definition-cache`` for form definitions was registered and used in ``FormService``. Use ``FormService`` in your modules - prevent to use any other service (e.g. ``IdmFormDefinitionService``) if it is possible. When you will create (or already have) integration test which creates (updates, delete) form definitions and this test is transactional (~rollback after test ends), then don't forget to clean up this (or all) caches (=> because rollback will be done).

## [10.4.1]

### Administrator

- ðŸŸ¢ [#2366](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/2366) - New caches were registered:
  - ``core:authorization-policy-cache`` - Cache stores active authorization policies of currently logged user. Cache is evicted after user log out. When authorization policies configuration is changed, then user is logged out and cache is evicted (after permissions removal only). Cache expiration is 2 hour, e.g. if user forgot to log out. **Memory usage per logged user is ~500KB, when 100 policies are used (~configured) for logged user**.
  - ``core:permission-cache`` - Cache stores permissions (for data) of currently logged user. Cache is evicted after user log out. Cache expiration is 1 minute - if data structure is changed, then permissions are actualized after this duration. When authorization policies configuration is changed, cache is evicted (completely). **Memory usage per logged user is ~4KB for every shown record** (cache expiration is 1 minute => when 1000 record details are shown in the same time, then 4MB is consumed by this cache).
  - (_edited 15.1.2021_) Decide if your project processes more than e.g. 500 concurrently logged users in an hour. In such case, consider increasing the size of the Java heap (``-Xmx`` in the Java options of the Tomcat service), otherwise there is nothing to worry.

 - ðŸŸ¢ [#2371](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/2371) You can see all approvers via clicking on the "..." now. Table of identities is limmited on first 100 approvers now. Limitation is necessary because IDs are send in GET request and these has limitation on 8kB.
Beware on some more strict limitation for size of GET request on the Apache server (we need 4kB now)!

## [10.4.0]

### Administrator

- ðŸŸ¡ [#1043](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/1043) - Automatic roles by tree structure were improved. Automatic roles by tree structure are recalculated after tree structure is changed (after node is moved in structure). Skipping recalculation of automatic roles by tree structure was added too and new [tree synchronization configuration is available](https://wiki.czechidm.com/devel/documentation/synchronization/dev/tree-sync#automatic_roles) - recalculation of automatic roles can be turned off in synchronization (now it works the same way as automatic roles by attributes).
  - (_edited 15.1.2021_) Check the settings of the **scheduled synchronizations of contracts** or contract slices in your project. Sometimes the option **``After end, start the automatic role recalculation`` is not checked in any of the synchronizations** and the task ``ProcessAllAutomaticRoleByAttributeTaskExecutor`` is scheduled separately in the task scheduler (if the project uses automatic roles by attributes). You have to **schedule a new task ``ProcessSkippedAutomaticRoleByTreeForContractTaskExecutor`` as well, otherwise the automatic roles by tree structure wouldn't be assigned/recalculated for users**.
- ðŸŸ¢ [#2296](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/2296) - Sidebar menu - added redirect on menu items with sub menu items (for ``Users``, ``Roles`` and ``Organization``). Menu item ``Role catalogue`` moved bellow ``Roles`` menu item. Menu items ``Structure nodes`` and ``Structure types`` moved bellow ``Organization`` menu item. Our goal is continue with reducing items in ``Settings`` menu in future releases.
- ðŸŸ¡ (_edited 15.1.2021_) [#2167](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/2167) - Tomcat startup parameter `-DuseLegacyMergeSort=true` is no longer needed and should be removed from the configuration. Check the configuration of the Tomcat service (typically ``/etc/systemd/system/tomcat.service`` in Linux, Java Options set by ``Tomcat8w.exe`` in Windows) and remove this parameter from the variable ``JAVA_OPTS``.
- ðŸŸ  (_edited 31.8.2020_) [#2046](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/2046) - Authentication against multiple systems was implemented and configuration property `idm.sec.security.auth.systemId` was **RENAMED** to `idm.sec.security.auth.system`. Please don't forget to rename it.

### Developer

- ðŸŸ¡ [#2158](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/2158) - ``Node version 12.16.3``, ``Npm 6.14.4``, ``Npx 6.14.4`` is used for developing and building CzechIdM.
- ðŸŸ¡ [#2282](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/2282) - ``FilterNotSupportedException`` exception was added. Exception is thrown, when unsupported filter is used from REST or on service layer. Make sure **all used filters are [registered properly](https://wiki.czechidm.com/devel/documentation/architecture/dev/filters) in your custom module!**. Unsupported filter usage is not possible now - exception will be thrown instead of skipping filter usage silently.
- ðŸŸ¢ [#2346](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/2346)
  - Skipping of sending notification after new workflow task was created not worked if ``default`` property (in task configuration) was used. You can fix this with using ``expression`` property instead ``default`` value in your workflow.
    <code><activiti:formProperty id="sendNotification" type="configuration" expression="false" writable="false"></activiti:formProperty></code>
  - The product workflow for change permissions was modified. There are three places, where notifications are sent directly from the workflow and universal notification sending after new task is created should be skipped. This skip were added to these tasks.
- ðŸŸ¢ [#2157](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/2157) - IdmTool now automatically resolves third-party module dependencies. It is no longer necessary to copy them into *modules/* directory by hand.

## [10.3.2]

- ðŸŸ¢ [#2285](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/2285) - ``IdmCacheManager#getValue(String, Object)`` returns ``ValueWrapper`` instead Optional. **Check cache manager usage in your module and change method return type to ValueWrapper.** When return value is ``null``, then value is not cached.
- ðŸŸ¢ [#2285](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/2285) -  Default cache size was changed to ``Long.MAX_VALUE`` (previous value was 2000). **Change cache size limit in your module if needed.**

## [10.3.0]

- ðŸŸ¢ [#2002](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/2002) - New method ``IdmIdentityService#findAllManagers(UUID, UUID, Boolean)`` was added. **Use this method to get managers of valid contracts (as approvers) in your custom scripts and workflows**. This new method is used in product workflows. All product [filters](https://wiki.czechidm.com/devel/documentation/architecture/dev/filters) for find managers were updated and new optional parameter ``validContractManagers`` was added - **change behavior in your custom (overriden) filters if needed**. Contract state (DISABLED) is ignored by this new filter - filter works just with contract dates.
  - (_edited 15.1.2021_) Note: This change doesn't affect transformation scripts which search for a manager of the primary contract of the identity, e.g. when filling the AD attribute "manager".
- ðŸŸ¡ (_edited 15.1.2021_) [#1146](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/1146) - Base permission ``CHANGEPERMISSION`` (Change Roles) added to identity contracts. This permission can be granted per contract instead of granting it to whole identity. This is necessary when configuring permissions for managers - so they will be able to change or assign roles only for the contracts, which they manage (this is the desired and also secure behavior). In all cases, **check that the role userRole contains ``Contracted positions (IdmIdentityContract)`` - ``IdentityContractByIdentityEvaluator`` permission** and if it doesn't, add it. Then, **check the usage of the permission ``Users (IdmIdentity)`` - ``Change Roles`` - ``SubordinatesEvaluator``.** If it is configured (most likely in ``userRole``), remove it and add **``Contracted positions (IdmIdentityContract)`` - ``Change Roles`` - ``SubordinateContractEvaluator``** instead. See also [configuration of this new permission](https://wiki.czechidm.com/devel/documentation/security/dev/authorization#manager_and_subordinates) and check that the role in question (most likely in ``userRole``) has all of this.
  - Note: Roles, which grant the permission ``Change Roles`` with different evaluator than ``SubordinatesEvaluator`` (e.g. Helpdesk role), don't have to be changed.
  - Note: Only if you have a really good reason, you can be 100 % backward compatible and allow managers to assign roles for all contracts. In such case, don't remove the ``IdmIdentity`` - ``Change Roles`` - ``SubordinatesEvaluator`` and only check/add the permission ``IdmIdentityContract`` - ``IdentityContractByIdentityEvaluator`` to the ``userRole``.
- ðŸŸ¢ Deprecated method ``GuaranteeManagersFilter#getGuaranteesPredicate(Root, CriteriaQuery, CriteriaBuilder, IdmIdentityFilter)`` was removed. @deprecated @since 9.7.0. Use ``GuaranteeManagersFilter#getGuaranteesPredicate(Root, AbstractQuery, CriteriaBuilder, IdmIdentityFilter)``.
- ðŸŸ¡ (_edited 15.1.2021_) [#2164](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/2164) - Obsolete configuration property ``idm.sec.core.identity.formAttributes.secured`` was removed => identity extended attributes are secured by default. **[Configure permissions to extended attributes](https://wiki.czechidm.com/devel/documentation/security/dev/authorization#settings_of_permissions_of_identity_form_extended_attribute_values) on your project** and remove usages of removed ``PrivateIdentityConfiguration#isFormAttributesSecured()`` method (always secured). Step by step:
  - Check if the project sets the property ``idm.sec.core.identity.formAttributes.secured`` and check the ``userRole`` and other roles, if they grant the permission ``IdmFormDefinition`` - ``View in select box (autocomplete)`` - ``BasePermissionEvaluator``.
  - A) ``idm.sec.core.identity.formAttributes.secured=true`` => there are most likely some roles, which grant permissions to display only specific extended attributes and all other roles don't. In such case, you don't need to do anything thanks to backwards compatibility.
  - B) ``idm.sec.core.identity.formAttributes.secured=false`` (or not configured at all) and permission ``IdmFormDefinition`` - ``View in select box (autocomplete)`` - ``BasePermissionEvaluator`` is **not** set in any role. It means that standard users couldn't see the extended attributes of identities. In such case, you don't need to do anything to be backwards compatible (the users won't see the attributes after upgrade as well).
  - C) ``idm.sec.core.identity.formAttributes.secured=false`` (or not configured at all) and permission ``IdmFormDefinition`` - ``View in select box (autocomplete)`` - ``BasePermissionEvaluator`` **is** set in some role. It means that the owners of the roles used to see the extended attributes by default. To keep it this way after upgrade, add the permission ``IdmIdentityFormValue`` - ``Read`` - ``IdentityFormValueEvaluator`` - ``By permission to read user``.
- ðŸŸ¡ (_edited 15.1.2021_) [#2219](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/2219) - **Deleting long running task is possible now under permission ``SCHEDULER_DELETE``** (previous duplicate ``LONGRUNNINGTASK_DELETE`` was removed). **New ``SCHEDULER_AUTOCOMPLETE`` permission was added** and is used to **show bulk action progress**. Configure this new permission on you project by [documentation](https://wiki.czechidm.com/devel/documentation/security/dev/authorization#default_settings_of_permissions_for_an_identity_profile) - i.e. add the permission ``IdmLongRunningTask`` - ``View in select box (autocomplete)`` - ``BasePermissionEvaluator`` to the role ``userRole``.
- ðŸŸ¡ (_edited 15.1.2021_) [#2163](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/2163) - Contract extended attributes are secured now. **[Configure permissions to extended attributes](https://wiki.czechidm.com/devel/documentation/security/dev/authorization#settings_of_permissions_of_contract_form_extended_attribute_values) on your project**.
  - Use similar steps to check your project as in the comment for #2164 above. If your project is in the situation C, add the permission ``IdmIdentityContractFormValue`` - ``Read`` - ``IdentityContractFormValueEvaluator`` - ``By permission to read contract`` to the affected roles, because their owners used to see the extended attributes (of contracts) by default.
  - On top of that, check if any roles grant permission for ``Form - values``. For such roles, add the aforementioned permission as well, so their owners can still see extended attributes of contracts after upgrade.
- ðŸŸ¡ (_edited 15.1.2021_) [#2206](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/2206) - **Basic identity attributes are secured now.** New permissions are needed to be configured to be able to update basic attributes. Find the roles which grant the permission ``IdmIdentity`` - ``Update`` in your project and **[configure permissions to change basic identity attributes](https://wiki.czechidm.com/devel/documentation/security/dev/authorization#settings_of_permissions_of_identity_basic_attributes)** to be backwards compatible.
- ðŸŸ¢ [#2206](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/2206) - Processor ``IdentityCheckChangeProjectionPermissionProcessor`` (added in version 10.2.0) renamed to ``IdentityCheckBasicAttributePermissionProcessor``. Permissions to change all basic identity attributes are checked now.
- ðŸŸ¡ (_edited 15.1.2021_) [#2225](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/2225) - Code lists and their items supports ``AUTOCOMPLETE`` permission. Code lists and items in select boxes are now secured by ``AUTOCOMPLETE`` permission as other select boxes (**``READ`` permission is not needed anymore** and it's recommended to remove it from the roles, if it was configured only as a workaround to correctly display some select boxes). **[Configure](https://wiki.czechidm.com/devel/documentation/security/dev/authorization#default_settings_of_permissions_for_an_identity_profile) ``AUTOCOMPLETE`` permission on your projects, where code list select boxes are used (e.g. environment, custom code lists in extended attributes).**
- ðŸŸ¢ [#2163](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/2156) - DTO for history of workflow tasks was redesigned. Since this version is  DTO **WorkflowHistoricTaskInstanceDto** extended by workflow task DTO **WorkflowTaskInstanceDto**. Some of a fields in **WorkflowHistoricTaskInstanceDto** were removed or renamed (candicateUsers, taskVariables)!
- ðŸŸ¢ [#2163](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/2156) - Workflow history task service was changed. Interface is same, but implementation of the **toResource** method was changed.
- ðŸŸ¢ [#2229](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/2229) - **Frontend component definition for identity form projection was removed** and replaced by backend registrable component. **See updated [documentation](https://wiki.czechidm.com/devel/documentation/identities/dev/user-type), how to register new identity form projection in you custom module**.
- ðŸŸ¢ [#1719](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/1719) - **IdmSecurityException** thrown as consequence of transformation script security failure is now caught and **enveloped** as cause **into ResultCodeException** of the **GROOVY_SCRIPT_ATTR_TRANSFORMATION_FAILED** type, which is newly propagated to UI.


## [10.2.0]

- ðŸŸ¢ New method ``ReadWriteDtoService#deleteAll(Iterable<DTO>, BasePermission)`` was added into service layer - shortcut to delete all dtos in one transaction.
- ðŸŸ¢ LRT ``CancelProvisioningQueueTaskExecutor`` is deprecated. LRT is not used, use bulk action ``ProvisioningOperationCancelBulkAction`` instead.
- ðŸŸ¢ [#2068](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/2068) - New menu section for identity (``identity-menu``) was added into module descriptors. This menu is shown from top navigation under logged identity username - this menu is replacement for previously defined **item with id ``identities-profile-system``, which is not configurable in module descriptor (section ``system``) and cannot be disabled now.** Items in this menu is registerable as other items in module descriptor.
- ðŸŸ¢ [#1837](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/1837) - Long running task rejection policy is implemented. For this reason, default product task executor configuration was changed and this change should be done for projects (but is not required), where default configuration is not used -
``scheduler.task.executor.queueCapacity=50``. With previously configured ``Integer.MAX`` value was ``scheduler.task.executor.maxPoolSize`` configuration ignored => ``scheduler.task.executor.corePoolSize`` was used only.
  - (_edited 15.1.2021_) Most projects don't need to change anything. If you have ``scheduler.task.executor.corePoolSize`` specifically configured or you have shortage of CPUs, consider changing this default value, otherwise leave default.
- ðŸŸ¢ [#2107](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/2107) - Default method implementation was added into filter interfaces ``CorrelationFilter``, ``FormableFilter``, ``ModifiedFromFilter``, ``ExternalIdentifiableFilter``, ``ModifiedFromFilter``, ``ModifiedTillFilter``, ``CreatedFromFilter``, ``CreatedTillFilter``. Filter interfaces reuse ``DataFilter`` functionality now. If you are using this interface in your custom module, check ``DataFilter`` superclass is used too. All auditable entities can be found by new filters (created and modified form / till - filters are registered automatically).
- ðŸŸ¢ [#2105](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/2105) - Loading eav attributes with owner entity support permissions now. If you are override method ``AbstractFormableService#getFormInstances(DTO)`` in your custom module, then add new parameter with permissions =>
``AbstractFormableService#getFormInstances(DTO, BasePermission...)`` init method definition. Method usage is backward compatible.
- ðŸŸ¢ [#2164](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/2164) - method ``PrivateIdentityConfiguration#isFormAttributesSecured`` is deprecated. Secured identity attributes will be supported only in future version. This configuration will be removed in the next version.
- ðŸŸ¢ [#2164](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/2164) - new method ``renderConfirm`` was added to frontend component ``AbstractIdentityDashboardButton``. **Use this method for your custom dashboard button, if button needs to show confirm dialog**. Confirm dialog cannot be closed otherwise, if it's rendered inside button content.
- ðŸŸ¡ [#2024](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/2024) - Support for cluster friendly cache manager for distributed cache was added. **Check cache manager usage in your custom module and add [cache configuration](https://wiki.czechidm.com/devel/documentation/caching#configuring_distributed_cache)**.

## [10.1.0]

- ðŸŸ¢ [#1711](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/1711) - Warning about leading and trailing whitespaces filled in form inputs will be shown automatically.
- ðŸŸ¢ [#1986](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/1986) - Bulk actions localization for remove entity were renamed from "remove" to "delete".
- ðŸŸ¢ [#2023](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/2023) - New "empty" option was added to all clearable select boxes used in filters and forms.

## [10.0.0]

- **All changes related to upgrade devstack dependencies can be found in [migration guide](./MIGRATION.md).**
- **Websocket** support removed - Removed all classed for websocket notifications
- [#1924](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/1924) - LRT ``PasswordExpiredTaskExecutor`` was scheduled by default to send notification for user after password expired and publish PASSWORD_EXPIRED event.

- Default database name configured for the all ``dev`` profiles was renamed to ``bcv_idm_10`` to prevent update (by flyway) old database on the background - **old database can be used for LTS version 9.7.x development**, so clone database is needed.

## [9.7.15]

- [#2042](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/2042) - LRT ``AccountProtectionExpirationTaskExecutor `` was scheduled by default.

## [9.7.12]

- [#1917](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/1917) - **Base permissions for roles, which can be requested, is used in copy assigned roles feature**. Configure this permissions (``CANBEREQUESTED``) to identity roles, which can be copied. Previously configured permissions ``READ`` on identity role will be not sufficient to copy roles in role request detail. **New authorization policy evaluator ``IdentityRoleByRoleEvaluator`` can be configured to add this permission to identity roles by role definition.** If you want to enable copying all assigned roles (the same behavior as before), then add ``BasePermissionEvaluator`` with permission ``CANBEREQUESTED`` for all assigned roles (``IdmIdentityRole`` entity).
- [#1932](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/1932) - LRT ``DeleteLongRunningTaskExecutor`` was created and scheduled by default to remove old executed long running tasks (``EXECUTED`` lrt older than 90 days will be removed by default schedule). Delete long running task is possible now (new permission ``LONGRUNNINGTASK_DELETE`` is needed) => **if you are using long running task reference in entity in your custom module, then custom processor (processing ``DELETE`` event with ``IdmLongRunningTaskDto`` content) has to be implemented (ensure referential integrity)**.
- [#1933](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/1933) - LRT ``DeleteNotificationTaskExecutor`` was created and scheduled by default to remove old sent notifications (``sent`` notifications older than 180 days will be removed by default schedule). Delete notificationa is possible now (new permission ``NOTIFICATION_DELETE`` is needed).
- [#1934](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/1934) - LRT ``DeleteSynchronizationLogTaskExecutor`` was created and scheduled by default to remove old synchronization logs (logs older than 180 days will be removed by default schedule).
- [#1413](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/1413) - Implemented merging of EAVs from slices to contract. Beware, only EAVs with changed value will be updated now.

## [9.7.9]

- [#1894](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/1894) - Virtual system request - Note for implementer was added. New method in service VsRequestService was added `realize(request, reason)`. From the FE is call only new method `realize(request, reason)` now! If some project overridden old method `realize(request)`, then you may be need to change it to the new one.

## [9.7.8]

- [#1887](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/1887) - Filling the value of ``validTill`` automatically for newly created assigned roles in bulk action for role assignment (``IdentityAddRoleBulkAction``) and in synchronization (default role creation) by related contract validity was removed.

## [9.7.7]

- Services ``IdmEntityEventService``, ``IdmEntityStateService`` and managers ``EntityEventManager``, ``EntityStateManager`` are usable in scripts now (``ScriptEnabled`` added).
- [#1851](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/1851) - Bulk action for recalculate accounts and provision (``RoleAccountManagementBulkAction``) on the role table works the same way as the same bulk action on the identity table - account management and provisioning is called synchronously in LRT, which is asynchronous itself (and event queue is not overused now).

## [9.7.5]

- [#1798](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/1798) - **New base permissions for roles, which can be requested, was added**. Configure this new permissions (``CANBEREQUESTED``) to role, which enables role requests for users. Previously configured permissions ``AUTOCOMPLETE`` on role will be not sufficient to see roles in role request detail (and in bulk actions for assign / remove assigned roles). ``AUTOCOMPLETE`` permission can be used  widely for select boxes. **If you have ``RoleCanBeRequestedEvaluator`` configured in you project already, just switch permission from ``AUTOCOMPLETE`` to ``CANBEREQUESTED``**.

## [9.7.3]

- [#1794](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/1794) Notification template with code ``vs:vsRequestCreated`` was changed. Please redeploy manually this notification template.
- [#1798](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/1798) - **New base permissions for disable / enable identity manually was added**. Configure this new permissions (``MANUALLYDISABLE``, ``MANUALLYENABLE``) to role, which enables bulk action and dashboard button for activate / deactivate user manually. Previously configured permissions ``UPDATE`` on identity will be not sufficient to execute this function.

## [9.7.0]
- Deprecated class (since 7.3.0) ``AuditableListener`` was removed. Use class ``AuditableEntityListener`` instead.
- Deprecated classes (since 7.7.0) for long running tasks placed in core ``impl`` package was removed. Used the same classes from core ``api``.
- [#1692](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/1692) - **The table of user roles changes has been redesigned**. All logic was move from frontend to backend. This new table (RequestIdentityRoleTable) is pageable, sorting, filtering on backend now.
   - For this table was created new DTO ``IdmRequestIdentityRoleDto``, representing change for specific identity-role entity.
   - For this table was created new REST endpoint too ``/request-identity-roles``. This endpoint can be calling with standard CRUD operations. Logic in this REST (service ``IdmRequestIdentityRoleService``) will be automatically creates role-concepts.
   - The finding method in this serivce compiles assigned identity-roles and role-concepts together and returns list of ``IdmRequestIdentityRoleDto``.
   - Sorting works separatly for identity-roles and concepts. For this reason are first returns concepts adding new assign roles. Then are returns currently assigned identity-roles. If for returns identity-role exists remove or update concept, then is identity-role marked as changed. Role-concepts and identity-roles are always returns as ``IdmRequestIdentityRoleDto``.
   - **For performance reasons, the REST endpoint for role-request, returns request without concepts** (from this version)! For same reason **``IdmRoleRequestService`` doesn't returns concepts in the request from now**. If you need to get request with a concepts, you can use this:  
    ```javascript
    roleRequestService.get(requestId, new IdmRoleRequestFilter(true));
    ```
- ``eslint 5.3.0`` library in version is used for FE - use new ``.eslintrc`` configuration file in your custom module (new rules was reused from ``airbnb``).
- History of workflow processes created (and synchronously ended) in synchronization will be delete from now (for prevent of too many records in activiti database).
- **NPM version 6.x.x or higher is required** for support of NPM lockfile (package-lock.json).
- ``FilterBuilder`` supports creating predicates for sub queries now. Use new ``getPredicate`` method with ``AbstractQuery`` parameter instead (method with ``CriteriaQuery`` parameter is deprecated and will be removed). All filters in core was updated to use ``AbstractQuery`` parameter - make sure you override this method in your custom module.
- Deprecated module ``gui`` was removed from product. Prevent to pull target folder, if you are product developer.
- Email templates ``changeIdentityRoleImplementer`` and ``changeIdentityRole`` were redesigned within task ``system state in request``
 [#1736](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/1736). **Please don't forget upgrade them (manually) in your projects.**
- [Filters](https://wiki.czechidm.com/devel/documentation/architecture/dev/filters#defaultcontractbymanagerfilter) by manager for subordinate contracts were added.


## [9.6.3]
- [#1668](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/1668) - ``EntityEventDeleteExecutedProcessor`` was removed. LRT ``DeleteExecutedEventTaskExecutor`` was created and scheduled by default to cover this functionality (executed events older than 3 days will be removed by default schedule).
- [#1393](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/1393) - Provisioned attributes (schema connector attribute names) are logged for provisioning operations in queue and archive. Is possible to filter by attributes used in provisioning context (updated, removed and empty provisioning). This feature is available for the new records in provisioning queue and archive. **Older records** (created before version 9.6.3 was installed) **will be filtered as empty provisioning without attributes** (attributes are empty).
- [#1647](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/1647) - LRT ``DeleteProvisioningArchiveTaskExecutor`` was created and scheduled by default to remove old provisioning archives (archived EXECUTED operations older than 90 days will be removed by default schedule).

## [9.6.0]
- [#1534](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/1534) - Incremental account management and provisioning:
  - Change/update/delete of the assigned roles (identity-roles) invoke account management only for changed identity-roles. No more for all identity-roles of the identity. If you need to execute account management for entire identity, then you can use bulk action "Recalculate accounts and provision".
  - Change/update/delete of the assigned roles (identity-roles) invoke provisioning only for touched accounts.
  - Return type for method ``AccAccountManagementService.deleteIdentityAccount`` was changed from ``void`` to ``List<UUID>``.
  - New methods (``resolveNewIdentityRoles``, ``resolveUpdatedIdentityRoles``) for incremental account management were added to service ``AccAccountManagementService``.
- [#1543](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/1543) - Realization of the role-request is executed asynchronously now. Processor ``RoleRequestRealizationProcessor`` catches event for type ``RoleRequestEventType.NOTIFY`` now (previously ``RoleRequestEventType.EXECUTION``).
- [#1543](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/1543) - **Parent event is not closed as ``EXECUTED`` automatically** - not needed anymore (used for asynchronous business roles in role request). Prevent to use second asynchronous processing in your modules (Request is processed asynchronously => it's not needed to process sub events asynchronously).
- [#514](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/514) - Records are saved in new transaction into provisioning queue - event if some connector throws unexpected exception (which doesn't generalize ``ProvisioningException``), then log with exception is available in queue. If you are using custom processor for event with ``SysProvisioningOperationDto`` content, don't forget to save this provisioning operation in new transaction too - use prepared ``SysProvisioningOperationService#saveOperation`` method.
- [#514](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/514) - **Notification after successful provisioning operation is not sent any more**. Information is available in application log under level ``INFO`` only for now. It is the same behavior as original default notification configuration for topic ``acc:provisioning`` with ``SUCCESS`` level. Notification about failed provisioning operation is still available (the same topic ``acc:provisioning`` with level ``ERROR``) and can be configured to email (sent to application log by default notification configuration).
- [#1185](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/1185) and [#1384](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/1384). Password metadata is now filled only by controller not service. Password chnage form has now different url path than before. Original: **/identity/:entityId/password** new **/identity/:entityId/password/change**. Please check all overriden forms and components for possible issues.
- Deprecated methods (since 7.7.0) ``SysProvisioningBatchRepository#findBatch`` were removed. Use method ``SysProvisioningBatchRepository#findAllBySystemEntity_IdOrderByCreatedAsc`` instead.
- Deprecated method (since 7.7.0) ``IdmNotificationTemplateService#getTemplateByCode`` was removed. Use method ``IdmNotificationTemplateService#getByCode`` instead.
- Deprecated method (since 7.8.0) ``IdmIdentityRepository#findAllByRole`` was removed. Use method ``IdmIdentityService#findAllByRole`` instead.
- Deprecated method (since 7.8.0) ``JwtAuthenticationMapper#getDTOAuthorities`` was removed. Use method ``JwtAuthenticationMapper#getDtoAuthorities`` instead.
- Deprecated method (since 8.2.0) ``SysProvisioningBatchService#findBatch(UUID, UUID, UUID)`` was removed. Use method ``SysProvisioningBatchService#findBatch(UUID)`` instead.


## [9.4.0]
- [#1372](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/1372) - HTTP status 206 for long running task supports download result from them.
- Deprecated static properties ``PARAMETER_PROPERTY`` and ``PARAMETER_VALUE`` defined in ``IdmTreeNodeFilter`` were removed (deprecated @since 8.2.0). Use static properties ``PARAMETER_CORRELATION_PROPERTY`` and ``PARAMETER_CORRELATION_VALUE`` instead.
- [#1378](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/1378) - Dashboard content was redesigned and split into two component - dashboard (system info) and identity dashboard (identity info). ``Index.js``, ``layout`` in frontend ``czechidm-app`` module was updated - don't forget to **update this module**, if project specific app module is used. Changes are backward compatible - previously created dashboards will be rendered in new dashboard content. New dashboard components with type ``identity-dashboard`` can be registered.
- Confidential storage agenda was hidden in menu. Confidential storage is still available in router on url ``<server>/confidential-storage`` and on rest api.
- Font Awesome library was upgraded to version 5. Backward compatibility with the old version 4 icon names was configured, but will be removed in release CzechIdM 10.x. Use new icon names - see the [documentation](https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/on-the-web/setup/upgrading-from-version-4#name-changes).
- Deprecated unused field **``parameters`` was removed from ``AuthorizationEvaluatorDto``** (deprecated since CzechIdM 8.2.0). Use form definition instead (field ``formDefinition``).
- Services for extended attributes definition ``IdmFormAttributeService`` and ``IdmFormDefinitionService`` support events now (constructors was changed).
- [#1474](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/1474) - Changing persistent type of form attribute is possible only if no values are persisted.
- [#1050](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/1050) - **Shortext as default** - When **EAV attribute** from mapped attribute was created, then (for string schema attributes) **PersistentType.TEXT** type was used as default. TEXT type cannot be indexed, so this type is not useful for searching. For this reason will be since version 9.4.0 as default type sets **PersistentType.SHORTTEXT**.
**Important**: Shortext is limmeted on max **2000** characters! Existing values (with old type) will be not modifed.
- [#1405](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/1405) - Code of workflow **Synchronization - Roles from LDAP** was changed from **'syncRoleAd'** to **'syncRoleLdap'**. More info in the ticket.



## [9.3.0]
- [#1290](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/1290) - ``SchedulableStatefulExecutor`` supports separating processing of items, read more in [documentation](https://wiki.czechidm.com/devel/documentation/application_configuration/dev/scheduled_tasks/task-scheduler#stateful_task_executors). Use new properties ``continueOnException``, ``requireNewTransaction`` in your custom LRT, when the same behavior is needed.
- [#1285](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/1285) - Password is now transformed via transformation script to resource. Beware all password including \_\_PASSWORD\_\_ must be marked as password attribute (attribute mapping detail). All password attributes **can't be overridden in role mapping**. Transformation script obtain password as GuardedString. **GuardedString or null must be returned by the script**. Password generation during create new account works same as before.
- [#1358](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/1358) - Frontend ``Tree`` component was redesigned from the scratch. I hope no one used original ``Tree`` component in custom modules (original was ugly and buged, I'm apologize :(), but if yes, check please your contents on frontend and use new properties respecting the component properties or the component's ``readme.txt`` - the main change is about removed header decorator and added ``onSelect``, ``onDetail`` callbacks instead. New tree component is used in forms (e.g. for creating new contract or position) - tree structure can be selected with tree usage now.
- [#1323](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/1323) - Provisioning ``Merge`` was redesigned. Controlled values in IdM are computed from transformations on role-system-attribute now. Provisioning archive is no longer used for merge. All system attributes was marked with 'evictControlledValuesCache = true'. We need ensure recalculation for all merge attribute (resolves state when somewho could set parent attribute strategy on different value than Merge). All merge attribute caches will be recalculated on first provisioning.
- [#1370](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/1370) - ``environment`` and ``baseCode`` attributes were added into ``IdmRole`` entity and dto:
  - Unique role's attribute ``code`` is combined from ``baseCode``, ``environment`` and with separator (``|`` by default).
  - It's possible to synchronize (or create) roles with the same ``baseCode`` and different ``environment``. ``Environment`` attribute is needed to use in synchronization mapping and correlation (e.g. attribute is filled by constant and this constant has to be used in correlation to e.g. ``<baseCode>|<environment>``. Change script was provided for switching current attribute mappings in synchronization for role's ``code`` attribute => ``baseCode`` is used now.
  - ``baseCode`` and ``code`` attribute is filled automatically on background, if only one is given, ``code`` can be still used (for maintain backward compatibility) => **no change is needed on your projects, if new ``environment`` attribute is not used**, otherwise ``baseCode`` should be used (exception will be thrown, if ``code`` and ``environment`` will be trying to change together - this is the reason, why change script for synchronization mapping was provided - it's not needed to change mapping for role's code (=> switched to ``baseCode``), just add mapping for the added environment).
- [#1225](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/1225) - Synchronization of identities now supports linking accounts to protection mode or not linking them at all, if the owner of the account doesn't have any valid contract. Synchronization also removes the flag "wish" from system entities if possible, so IdM has correct information about existing accounts in the target system.
- [#1361](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/1361) - Email notification can send attachments. Sent attachments are not persisted automatically and it's possible to send them from backend only. Attachments (``IdmAttachmentDto``) can be instanced (``inputData`` will be used, if it's not {@code null}), or persisted before - data will be loaded by ``AttachmentManager``, when email is send (see ``DefaultEmailer``).

## [9.2.2]
- [#1322](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/1322) - Preferred language and collapsed navigation is persisted to identity profile now and is loaded after login. Selecting locale doesn't refresh whole page now - add listening redux property ``i18nReady: state.config.get('i18nReady')`` if you content is not refreshed automatically and use localization.
- ``Index.js`` in frontend ``czechidm-app`` module was updated - don't forget to **update this module**, if project specific app module is used.

## [9.2.0]
- [#1261](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/1261) - Internal processing of events in ``AbstractEntityEventProcessor`` was improved. It's possible to create processor for super classes, e.g. one processor can handle all BaseDto generalizations. ``AbstractEntityEventProcessor#onApplicationEvent`` method intercepts ``ApplicationEvent`` now - this method is not in ``EntityEventProcessor`` interface, but if you overrided her in custom processor, refactor your processors to new input parameter.
- [#1267](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/1267) - Eav attribute values can be saved together with owner - e.g. save identity with filled eavs. ``FormableDto`` super class was added and has to be defined for all dtos with eav support - change generalization tor your custom dtos with eav attribute support from ``AbstractDto`` to new ``FormableDto``.
- [#1272](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/1272) - Default value is not used for new extended attributes on entity details. Make sure your custom component implementing ``AbstractFormAttributeRenderer`` behaves the same way, if ``#toInputValue`` method was overrided. Sending read only (~disabled) extended attribute values from FE to BE was removed - read only attributes can be secured and this check worked only if value is not changed in the meantime (update and security check was skipped). Now it will be more transparent.
- [#1259](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/1259) - New agenda for generated values was created. Now is possible generate for example username, email and eavs. Agenda now supports only ``IdmIdentity`` and their eavs.
- [#1281](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/1281) - Websocket notifications are no longer supported. Configured websocket notifications are sent to configured global default notification sender (console by default). Reconfigure your custom topics, which uses websocket, to other notification type (e.g. email, console). Websocket sender and service (FE+BE) is marked as deprecated and they are not initialized by default - move senders to your project if needed (don't forget to copy and rename (or create) the new table for saving websocket notification logs in your database - table ``idm_notification_websocket`` will be removed in next major release). ``Index.js`` in frontend ``czechidm-app`` module was updated - don't forget to **update this module**, if project specific app module is used.
- [#1287](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/1287 - New generate type for passwords - prefixes and suffixes) Is possible generated passwords with prefixes and suffixes. Both strings are optional and can be setup only for generated password policy. Prefix and suffix are not counted into maximum and minimum length.
- [#1158](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/1158) - Long running task implement Configurable interface now. Form definition can be used for LRT configuration.


## [9.1.0]
- Authentication is not needed for using Spring Data queries in repositories (fixed mainly for test purposes).
- Role code is used in role select boxes (code is shown, only if name is different than code).
- [#1145](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/1145) - Other contract positions can be configured. Other positions are used for assign automatic roles by tree nodes.
- ``Index.js`` in frontend ``czechidm-app`` module was updated - don't forget to **update this module**, if project specific app module is used.

## [9.0.0]
- [#1200](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/1200) - Business roles:
  - ``code`` unique attribute added to ``IdmRole`` entity - filled by ``name`` values by default . ``name`` attribute is not unique anymore - **use code attribute in your modules** for lookup roles. ``name`` is used as user friendly role name on frontend. Both fields ``name`` and ``code`` are required on controller layer.
  - Deprecated ``IdmRoleService#getByName`` method was removed - use ``IdmRoleService#getByCode`` method.
  - Deprecated lazy lists were removed from ``IdmRole``, ``IdmRoleDto`` - ``subRoles``, ``superiorRoles``, ``guarantees``, ``roleCatalogues``. Check usage of this lists in your modules and replace them with appropriate services.
  - Make sure all your workflow processes are correctly ended - ``IdmRole``, ``IdmRoleDto``, ``IdmIdentityRole`, ``IdmIdentityRoleDto``, ``IdmConceptRoleRequestDto`` structure changed.
   - All Lazy lists from  `IdmRole``, ``IdmRoleDto`` were removed - see above.
   - ``roleTreeNode`` attribute was renamed to ``automaticRole`` (previous ``automaticRole`` boolean flag was removed) in dtos ``IdmIdentityRoleDto``, ``IdmConceptRoleRequestDto``.Check attribute ``automaticRole`` (for automatic role) or ``directRole`` (for sub roles of business role) - this assigned roles cannot be removed directly. ``IdmAutomaticRoleAttributeService#ROLE_TREE_NODE_ATTRIBUTE_NAME`` was removed (used just for compatibility issues, which is not needed anymore) - use standard ``IdmIdentityRole_.automaticRole`` metamodel.
  - Obsolete, deprecated and unused methods ``IdmRoleRepository#findOneByName``,``IdmRoleRepository#getPersistedRole`` and ``IdmRoleRepository#getSubroles`` removed. Use ``IdmRoleService`` instead (with filter usage).
  - ``RoleGuaranteeEvaluator`` - evaluator supports guarantees configured by identity and by role now.
  - **Role guarantees, business roles (composition), role catalogues, tree nodes supports authorization policies now - configure [authorization policies](https://wiki.czechidm.com/devel/documentation/security/dev/authorization#default_settings_of_permissions_for_a_role_detail).**
- Event mechanism was improved:
  - ``EntityEventManager`` constants for event properties were moved directly into ``EntityEvent``. Use event getters and setters to use property values.
  - Parent event can be propagated, when sub event is created by the parent event. Executing account management was improved thanks to this mechanism - is called after change role request is executed (not for the all single assigned roles). When role is assigned outside the request (directly in some backend business logic), then account management s executed the same way as before - for each assigned role.
  - child events are deleted automatically - remove events from event queue will be easier.
- Method ``IdmAuthorizationPolicyService#getEnabledPersistedRoleAuthorities`` was removed - use previously loaded dto in event processing.
- [#1204](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/1204) - Reschedule HR long running task  ``HrEnableContractProcess`` - processed item queue should be cleared

## [8.2.0]

- [#1125](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/1125) - Identity extended attributes supports authorization policies, read [more](https://wiki.czechidm.com/devel/documentation/security/dev/authorization#secure_identity_form_extended_attribute_values).

  - SynchronizationService is no longer LRT (Long Running Task).
  - Event types and processors to start and cancel sync has been removed.
- [#636](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/636) - JWT token are persisted now. **JWT token doesn't contain authorities now - use ''LoginDto.authorities'' instead**. JWT contains only authentication data. Logout feature is supported now. ``AuthenticationTestUtils`` was removed - this utility used SecurityContext directly and this was dangerous (identity id was not filled and authorization policies was skipped). ``IdmAuthorityChange`` entity and repository was removed at all - ``IdmTokenDto`` and ``DefaultTokenManager`` can be used now.
- [#1163](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/1163) - ``ConfidentialStorage`` service supports ``AbstractDto`` as value owner now. Check your module, where ``AbstractDto`` as owner for ``ConfidentialStorage`` was used before this update and provide appropriate change script if needed (see ``V8_02_006__confidential-storage-support-identifiable-owner.sql``).

## [8.1.7]
- ``Index.js`` in frontend ``czechidm-app`` module was updated - don't forget to **update this module**, if project specific app module is used.

## [8.1.3]

- ``Configurable`` interface contains form definition now. ``Configurable`` instances can be configured by eav form on frontend (the richer ui). **Methods ``getFormDefinition`` and ``getFormAttributes`` were moved to ``Configurable`` interface from ``AbstractReportExecutor`` super class. Make sure you are using ``public`` modifier on this methods in your reports**.
- [#1153](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/1153) - Add event support for ``IdmPasswordDto`` (create, update, delete)

## [8.1.2]

- [#1137](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/1137) - Sync of slices does not use contract EAV definition

## [8.1.1]

- [#1128](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/1128) - Event processing - check parent event type for duplicates.
- [#1129](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/1129) - Boolean eav attribute with default value.
- [#1135](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/1135) - Bulk actions evaluates permission on frontend in select box. Problem with filtering and selecting identities was fixed (permission are now evaluated correctly). AbstractBulkAction is now part of api, AbstractIdentityBulkAction was removed from impl package and functionality was moved to api. For all bulk action is now used Enabled annotation for check if action is enabled/disabled.


## [[8.1.0](https://github.com/bcvsolutions/CzechIdMng/releases/tag/8.1.0)]

- Bulk action for identities - More about bulk backend actions you can find [here](https://wiki.czechidm.com/devel/documentation/bulk_actions).
- Time slices of contracts - More about time slices you can find [here](https://wiki.czechidm.com/devel/documentation/identities#time_slices_of_the_contractual_relationship).
- Password history - More about password history you can find [here](https://wiki.czechidm.com/8.0/documentation/security/dev/password-policies#standard_policy_for_validation).
- [#1076](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/1076) -  Extended form value - added support for ``org.joda.time.LocalDate`` and string in ISO 8601 format as value for DATE or DATETIME persistent type. Persistent type INT, LONG, BOOLEAN - supports setting string value now (default conversions from string representation added ~ the same meaning as``#valueOf(String)``).
- [#853](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/853) - Extended form values without filled values (``null``) are not saved.

## [8.0.0]

- [#938](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/938) - Requests for automatic assign roles (by tree node or attributes) was implemented.
 - Creating, updating, deleting of the any automatic role **must use** this requests. Requests are approval by "same" workflows as request for roles uses.
 - Create, update, delete methods from `IdmAutomaticRoleAttributeController` was **removed**. Method `/delete-via-request/` was **added** to this controller. This method creates request for delete given automatic role.
- Detail of user - frontend validation that required at least 3 characters for the user name was removed.
- [#468](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/468) - Added asynchronous event processing. Added asynchronous event type ``NOTIFY`` on identities, identity roles, roles, contracts, contract guarantees, role catalogues, tree nodes - notify about entity was changed. Processors could listen and process this new event asynchronously. Read more in [documentation](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/468). Account management and process automatic roles was switched to asynchronous processing by default (instead ``DELETE`` events - removing identity, their role or contact will be still synchronous). Check please your custom processors for automatic roles and account management - make sure they will work with new ``NOTIFY`` event. Make sure source file **``czechidm-app/src/Index.js``** on frontend is updated - flash message with localized processors was added.
- [#979](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/979) - Attribute modified from ``AbstractEntity`` isn't audited anymore. Modified date can be found in ``IdmAudit`` as revision ``timestamp``.
- **``Marked``** library was removed from frontend. Use standard localizations for writing inline help and documentation.

## [7.8.5]

- [#1037](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/1037) - Fix pageable in automatic role recalculation.

## [7.8.3]
- [#1005](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/1005) - Dry run is available for long running task which supports it.
- [#1000](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/1000) - Persistent type ``SHORTTEXT`` was added to eav forms. Change script for all CzechIdM tables for persist eav values is provided  - provide the same change script in your module, if extended attributes was added to custom entity. ``SHORTTEXT`` and ``UUID`` values are indexed now.
- [#980](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/980) - Improved performance with recalculation automatic roles and skip recalculation during synchronization.

## [7.8.0]

- [#857](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/857) - Filters - added support for multiple filter parameters, `MultiValueMap` is used.
- [#274](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/274) - Filters for entity event processors was added.


## [7.7.0]

### Added

  - [#920](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/920) - Event processor - support conditional processing. New method ``EntityEventProcessor#conditional``.
  - [#922](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/922) - ``IdmIdentityService#findValidByRole`` method was added - return valid identities with assigned valid role (valid contract and identity role relation).
  - [#842](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/842) - Add new automatic roles by attribute and refactor current automatic role by tree structure. Backward compatibility of current automatic role and assigned roles is guaranteed.
  - Workflow task instances has permissions now. You should add ``WORKFLOWTASK_READ`` permission for default user role.

### Changed

  - All workflow services and controllers now using DTO layer, for more information read [#529](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/529).

## [7.6.1]

### Added

- [#870](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/870) - Cannot save 0x00 to Postgres column - Provisioning operation.
- [#621](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/621) - add dry run mode and long running task detail with processed items.
- [#784](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/784) - notification template info card improvements.


## [7.6.0]

### Removed

##### Role request
- Method ``startRequestNewTransactional(UUID requestId, boolean checkRight)`` was removed from interface IdmRoleRequestService (now is using only in implementation).

##### Evaluator 'IdentityAccountByIdentityEvaluator'
- Evaluator 'IdentityAccountByIdentityEvaluator' was removed and replaced by 'IdentityAccountByAccountEvaluator'.

##### AccAccountService
- Deprecated method 'delete(AccAccountDto account, boolean deleteTargetAccount, UUID entityId)' was removed. AccAccountService supported events now, parameters 'deleteTargetAccount' and 'entityId' were transformed to properties of delete event.

##### ProvisioningOperation
- In the task #798, we solved problem with not updated UID value in Provisioning operation. This occurred when was two and more provisioning operations in the queue and when first provisioning (traged system) changed UID of the account. Next provisionings in the queue was wrong (old) value of UID. This was fixed (provisioning operation has relation on the system entity now).
- Beware - before update we recommand solve/cancel all active provisioning operations. We need to create new column "system_entity_id" and remove old "system_entity_uid". In the change script we will try transform data in the provisioning operation table (from string uid to the ID), but it may not be fully sucessfuly.

### Changed

- Method ``saveAndFlush`` was added into ``BaseEntityRepository`` and this method is used now for saving all dtos - see ``AbstractReadWriteDtoService#saveInternal``. Auditable dto's metadata (e.g. ``modifier``, ``modified``) are available now after dto is saved by ``IdentitySevaProcessor``, for more information read [#834](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/834).

##### Sync
- Since version **7.6 (in identity synchronization)**, the default contractual relationship (when creating a new identity) is not created, for more information read [#867](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/867)!

##### Identity
- Identity's last name attribute is optional, change script was provided. Make sure you check identity's last name for ``null`` values, in your project.

##### Script

- Methods ``IdmScriptService#getScriptByName``, ``IdmScriptService#getScriptByCode`` are deprecated and will be removed - use ``IdmScriptService#getByCode`` method instead.

##### Long running task
- Abstract tasks in package `eu.bcvsolutions.idm.core.scheduler.service.impl` are deprecated and will be removed, use new tasks in api:
  - `eu.bcvsolutions.idm.core.scheduler.api.service.AbstractLongRunningTaskExecutor`
  - `eu.bcvsolutions.idm.core.scheduler.api.service.AbstractSchedulableStatefulExecutor`
  - `eu.bcvsolutions.idm.core.scheduler.api.service.AbstractSchedulableTaskExecutor`
  - `eu.bcvsolutions.idm.core.scheduler.api.service.StatelessAsynchronousTask`

### Added

- [#780](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/780) - Path with resources - support multiple locations for scripts, notification templates and workflow definitions.

##### Identity

- [#815](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/815) - Identity state was added. When identity starts to be valid, then new password is generated for all their accounts - one password is set on all identity's accounts and in CzechIdM. Identity can be disabled (and enabled) manually through rest endpoint. Other states are controlled by system and by identity contract states.

##### Report module
- Reports are available now, read more in documentation.

##### Attachment manager
- Saving binary files to filesystem is supported now, read more in documentation.

##### Common forms
- `CommonFormService` is used for saving report filter and configuration for long running taskc
- `IdmFormDefinitionService#updateDefinition` is used for updating form definitions for common forms automatically (see compatible vs incompatible changes).


## [7.5.2]

#### Acc module

- [#797](https://redmine.czechidm.com/issues/797) - target system security was hidden by provisioning break (fixed). ``SysSystemRepository#find`` method is deprecated and will be removed - use ``SysSystemService#find`` method instead.

## [7.5.1]

##### Contractual relation

- Long running tasks (LRT) for HR processes were restored - they are useful for pre-production checks (disable processors + show what LRT wants to process).

## [7.5.0]

### Added

#### Core module

##### Scheduler

- Added ``DependentTaskTrigger`` - execute task, when other task successfully ended. Dependent tasks are executed by ``LongRunningTaskExecuteDependentProcessor``.

#### Acc module

##### System
- Add three new attributes for block system provisioning operation (createOperation, updateOperation, deleteOperation). All these attributes has default value false.


##### Provisioning

- After add, remove or update ``IdmContractGuaranteeDto`` is execute provisioning for identity that own this contract.
- It's possible to send additional attributes, when password is changed (e.g. password expiration in extended attribute). New flag ``sendOnPasswordChange`` was added to system attribute mapping - attribute with this flag checked will be send together with changed password to provisioning. Two ways for provisioning additional attributes are implemented:
  - send additional attributes together with new password in one provisioning operation
  - send additional attributes after password is changed in another provisioning operation
    - two ways are be configurable by application configuration ``idm.sec.acc.provisioning.sendPasswordAttributesTogether`` (is effective for all target systems):
    - ``true``: additional password attributes will be send in one provisioning operation together with password
    - ``false``: additional password attributes will be send in new provisioning operation, after password change operation
- Add provisioning break for basic operations (create, update, delete), provisioning break can be set per system or globally for all systems.

### Changed

##### Identity

- Warning notifications about expired password and before password expiration are not send to disabled identities.
- Base permission ``CHANGEPERMISSION`` was added for identities. This permission is used for evaluating rights to identity's role requests - changing identity permissions. Add this new permission to your configured authorization policies (e.g for SelfIdentityEvaluator, SubordinatesEvaluator).

##### Contractual relation

- Service ``IdmContractGuaranteeService`` now implements EventableDtoService for method save and delete.
- Attribute ``state`` was added. Attribute disabled was removed from ``IdmIdentityContractDto`` as redundant to new state. Previously disabled contracts is enabled with state ``ECXLUDED`` - change script is provided. Contract with state ``DISABLED`` is invalid now - all processed work with this state (automatic roles, end of contract process).
- Contract processors were moved into ``eu.bcvsolutions.idm.core.model.event.processor.contract`` package:
  - ``IdentityContractCreateByAutomaticRoleProcessor``
  - ``IdentityContractDeleteProcessor``
  - ``IdentityContractSaveProcessor``
  - ``IdentityContractUpdateByAutomaticRoleProcessor``
- Business logic from HR long running tasks (LRT) for HR processes was moved into processors. Enable / disable identity with no valid or excluded contracts is executed immediately after contract is changed. HR processors are using almost the same workflow as LRT (LRT variables were removed only), but its configurable now. Long running task were removed and will be unscheduled automatically after new version will be installed:
  - ``AbstractWorkflowEventProcessor``
  - ``HrContractExclusionProcess``
  - ``HrEnableContractProcess``
  - ``HrEndContractProcess``

### Removed

#### Core module

##### Identity

- Password reset functionality was removed from core module. Password reset will be standalone module.

##### Contractual relation

- ``IdmIdentityContractRepository#deleteByIdentity`` was removed. It was skipping audit (bug).

## [7.4.0]

### Requirements

#### All workflow instances (task) have to be closed (resolved / canceled) before update. Some services were refactored and new workflow definitions (core) will be installed automatically.

### Added

#### Core module

##### Long running task

- New long running task ExecuteScriptTaskExecutor, this task can execute any of scripts in DEFAULT category.
- new long running task RemoveOldLogsTaskExecutor for remove logging event, logging event exception and logging event property.
- ``@DisallowConcurrentExecution`` can be used for prevent to execute task concurrently.

### Changed

- CGLIB for creating proxies are enforced by default. Now is possible to use annotations on methods, which is not defined in service interface. Prevent to use some logic in service constructors and always define annotations in implementation class, [read more](https://www.credera.com/blog/technology-insights/open-source-technology-insights/aspect-oriented-programming-in-spring-boot-part-2-spring-jdk-proxies-vs-cglib-vs-aspectj/). Make sure you have ``spring.aop.proxy-target-class=true`` property configured in your project.

#### Core module
- Application property **idm.pub.core.notification.template.folder** was changed to **idm.sec.core.notification.template.folder**.
- Application property **idm.pub.core.notification.template.fileSuffix** was changed to **idm.sec.core.notification.template.fileSuffix**.
- Application property **idm.pub.core.script.folder** was changed to **idm.sec.core.script.folder**.

##### Identity

- Deprecated method ``IdmIdentityService#saveIdentity`` was removed. Use ``save``or ``publish`` method instead.
- Method ``IdmIdentityService#passwordChange`` don't modify given password change dto - results was added.  

##### Event processiong

- Added ``AbstractEventableDtoService`` for simplify services working with events. ``CoreEvent`` with ``CoreEventType`` is published by default now for save and delete event for all domain types (e.g. ``IdmIdentityDto``, ``IdmIdentityContractDto``, ``IdmRoleCatalogueDto``, ``IdmIdentityRoleDto`` ...). **Check [appropriate event type comparison](https://wiki.czechidm.com/devel/dev/architecture/events#event_types)** in your project.

##### Password policy

- Entity IdmPasswordPolicy was transformed to DTO. Update all places where call from your project service IdmPasswordPolicyService. The service now uses DTO only. Also check your current scripts and their authorities. If you're overloaded any of frontend component which is related IdmPasswordPolicy, check her functionality.
- The attributes of IdmPasswordPolicy are now Integer (in past int). Please Check your password policy settings and remove redundant zeros in settings. The zero in the setting is already taken as a valid setting value.

##### Script

- Script with category DEFAULT can be executed from executor with another category.

##### Confidential storage

- The encryption of the confidential agenda can now be done using the key from application properties, also file with key may be defined in application properties. Backward compatibility with key defined in resource **isn't maintained**. If your project using key directly saved in **.war** on path  **<war>/lib/idm-core-impl-<version>.jar/eu/bcvsolutions/idm/confidential/key.key**, move your key outside the **.war** and configure application property ``cipher.crypt.secret.keyPath``.

##### Notifications

- Api ``NotificationSender`` was changed. Now are returned all notifications that is sent. Also mechanism of sending with topic was fixed. Check your project notification configuration.


##### Role

- Role agenda was refactored to dto usage. Search **``IdmRoleService``** usage in your project - **all methods works with dto**, entity service methods were removed (e.q. ``findSecured``). **In workflow ``roleSevice.get(roleId, null)`` method has to be used**.
- **``GrantedAuthoritiesFactory#getActiveRoleAuthorities(UUID identityId, IdmRoleDto role)``** - method using role dto as parameter.
- **``IdmRoleDto`` is used as event content - change all entity event processors from template ``IdmRole`` to ``IdmRoleDto`` in your project.** ``RoleEvent`` uses ``IdmRoleDto`` content too.
- Rest endpoint - changed role lists structure (``IdmRoleGuaranteeDto, IdmRoleCatalogueDto`` are used) - uuid only is needed, when relation is created and updated.
- ``IdmRoleGuaranteeRepository`` - removed methods ``deleteByGuarantee_Id``, ``deleteByRole`` - service layer has to be used for create audit records.
- **``RoleFilter``** was **moved to core api** module and renamed to ``IdmRoleFilter`` - we will add ``Idm`` prefix to all core filters.
- **``IdmRoleFilter``** - fields are ``UUID`` now - **roleCatalogue => roleCatalogueId**, **guarantee => guaranteeId**

##### Role request

- Added authorization policies support. New [authorization policy evaluators](https://wiki.czechidm.com/devel/dev/security/change-user-permissions#security) has to be [configured](https://wiki.czechidm.com/devel/dev/security/authorization#default_settings_of_permissions_for_an_identity_profile) to add permission for role requests. Added new permission group ``ROLEREQUEST``.
- Don't use **``IdmRoleRequestRepository#find()``** and **``IdmConceptRoleRequestRepository#find()``** methods directly => use service layer (methods are using criteria api now).
- Role request navigation item was moved to audit and enabled for all logged users - can read their own role requests history.

##### Tree structure

- Tree type and node agendas were refactored to dto usage. Search **``IdmTreeTypeService``** usage in your project - **all methods works with dto**. Search **``IdmTreeNodeService``** usage in your project - **all methods works with dto**.
- **``IdmTreeTypeService``** supports events (``CREATE``, ``UPDATE``, ``DELETE``).
- **``IdmTreeTypeService#getConfigurations(UUID)`` uses uuid as parameter**.
- **``IdmTreeTypeRepository#clearDefaultTreeType()``** was removed - configuration service is used for persist default tree type and node.
- **``IdmTreeTypeRepository#clearDefaultTreeNode()``** was removed - configuration service is used for persist default tree type and node.
- **``IdmTreeTypeRepository#findOneByDefaultTreeTypeIsTrue()``** was removed - configuration service is used for persist default tree type and node.
- **``IdmTreeTypeService#clearDefaultTreeNode()``** was removed - configuration service is used for persist default tree type and node.
- ``TreeConfiguration`` was added - provide default tree node and type. This configuration is used in ``DefaultIdmIdentityContractService``, ``DeafultIdmTreeNodeService`` constructors.
- **``IdmTreeTypeFilter``** is used as filter in ``IdmTreeTypeService`` - its possible to find types by code from rest api.
- **``TreeNodeFilter``** was renamed to **``IdmTreeNodeFilter``**. Its possible to find node by type and code from rest api.

- **Added authorization policies support.** Authorization policies has to be configured to add permission for form definition and attribute administration. ``BasePermissionEvaluator`` can be used. Permission groups were renamed to ``FORMDEFINITION`` and ``FORMATTRIBUTE``.
- **Confidential values are stored under form attribute identifier now.** Form attribute's code can be changed and stored confidential values were identified by code - can be lost after code is changed. Change script ``V1_00_028__eav-change-confidential-storage-key.sql`` is provided - provide the same change script in your module, if extended attributes was added to custom entity.
- Form attribute has new field ``faceType`` with contains information about attribute rendering on FE. Persistent types ``TEXTAREA``, ``RICHTEXTAREA``, ``CURRENCY`` were removed and appropriate face types were added. ``Change script V1_00_029__eav-add-face-type.sql`` is provided - provide the same change script in your module, if extended attributes was added to custom entity. Face type can be added in custom module for change (add) attribute rendered - its used mainly for select boxes.
